# random_jokes
Description:

The Flutter Joke App is a well-crafted mobile application designed to bring moments of humor and laughter to users' lives. This application leverages the power of the Flutter framework to create a seamless and delightful user experience.

Key Features:

Joke Fetching: The app makes use of a RESTful API to fetch random jokes. These jokes are pulled from a curated database, ensuring high-quality and entertaining content.

User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is thoughtfully designed with an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing layout. It offers a clean and responsive design, making it easy for users to access their daily dose of humor.

Randomization: Users can simply open the app, and with the press of a button or a swipe, a new joke is presented. The randomization feature ensures that each visit is a fresh experience, adding an element of surprise and anticipation.

Technical Details:

Flutter Framework: The app is built using the Flutter framework, which offers cross-platform capabilities, ensuring that it can run seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

API Integration: It communicates with a third-party joke API via HTTP requests to fetch random jokes. The app also handles error scenarios gracefully, providing a robust user experience.

State Management: The app uses state management techniques such as Provider or Bloc to efficiently manage the application's state, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions.

Persistent Storage: User preferences and saved jokes are stored securely on the device using local storage, allowing for quick retrieval and a personalized user experience.

Responsiveness: The app is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing experience on various devices.

Attention:

The code may appear complex at first glance. I've incorporated new Dart 3 features, such as sealed classes, alongside the tried-and-true InheritedWidget. It's important to note that this code is a work in progress, and I'm actively working on expanding its functionality.

i will try to make updates daily to this project 

 chat gpt can't understand this code because dart 3 was released after 2021 plus the the new switchexpression was defined early this year XD
